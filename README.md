# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Using third-party API, [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), my app retrieves weather data for cities both domestic and international. The Weather Dashboard also stores past searches for easy reference at the click of a button.

The Weather Dashboard is responsive, runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Installation

After loading the page, type any city into the search box to return the current weather and a five-day forecast. The most recent five searches will be stored as clickable buttons on the left. To view the weather in a past search, just click on that city's button.
